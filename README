NAME
    CPAN::Testers::Config - Manage CPAN Testers configuration data

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
         use CPAN::Testers::Config;
 
         $config = CPAN::Testers::Config->read;
         $config->{global}{profile} = 'my_profile.json';
         $config->write;

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN::Testers::Config provides a very simple interface to load and save
    CPAN Testers configuration data using only core Perl modules.

    By default, configuration is stored in '.cpantesters/config.pl' in the
    user's home directory. Data is serialized using Data::Dumper.

SCHEMA
    Configuration is provided as a hash of hashes. No formal schema has been
    defined yet for CPAN Testers configuration and thus there is no
    validation by this module.

    The top-level key "global" is reserved for data that will be used by
    multiple CPAN Testers modules. Only keys listed in the "Global
    Configuration Keys" section should be used in the "global" hash.

    Module-specific configuration data should be stored under a top-level
    key corresponding to the module name. For example:

       # global
       $metabase_profile = $config->{global}{profile};
 
       # module-specific
       $config->{'CPAN::Testers::Client'}{send_duplicates} = 1;

  Global Configuration Keys
    The following key(s) are defined. No other keys should be added or
    expected.

    Proposed new global keys should be sent to the maintainer(s) of this
    module and/or the CPAN Testers Discussion
    <https://www.socialtext.net/perl5/index.cgi?cpan_testers> mailing list.

   "profile"
    A path to a filename containing a CPAN Testers 2.0 user profile; if not
    an absolute path, it should be treated as a path relative to the CPAN
    Testers configuration directory

USAGE
  new
       $config = CPAN::Testers::Config->new( %data );

    Creates and returns a new configuration object with optional starting
    data or dies.

  read
       $config = CPAN::Tester::Config->read;
       # ... modify $config ...
       $config->read; # reload

    Returns a configuration object with data loaded from the configuration
    file or dies. May be called either as a class method or an object
    method.

  write
       $config->write;

    Serializes a configuration object to the the configuration file or dies.
    Returns the object as a convenience on success.

  config_dir
       $dir = CPAN::Testers::Config->config_dir;

    Returns a path to the CPAN Testers configuration directory. See
    "ENVIRONMENT".

  config_file
       $file = CPAN::Testers::Config->config_file;

    Returns a path to the CPAN Testers configuration file. See
    "ENVIRONMENT".

ENVIRONMENT
  CPAN_TESTERS_DIR
    Specifies an alternate directory to search for CPAN Testers
    configuration files instead of the default '.cpantesters' in the user's
    home directory.

  CPAN_TESTERS_CONFIG
    Specifies an alternate file for configuration data instead of
    'config.pl' in the default or alternate configuration directory.
